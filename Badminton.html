      <p>Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquet to hit a shuttlecock
        across a net. Although it may be played with larger teams, the most
        common forms of the game are "singles" (with one player per side) and
        "doubles" (with two players per side). Badminton is often played as a
        casual outdoor activity in a yard or on a beach; formal games are played
        on a rectangular indoor court. Points are scored by striking the
        shuttlecock with the racquet and landing it within the opposing side's
        half of the court.</p>
      <p>Each side may only strike the shuttlecock once before it passes over
        the net. Play ends once the shuttlecock has struck the floor or if a
        fault has been called by the umpire, service judge, or (in their
        absence) the opposing side.</p>
      <p>The shuttlecock is a feathered or (in informal matches) plastic
        projectile which flies differently from the balls used in many other
        sports. In particular, the feathers create much higher drag, causing the
        shuttlecock to decelerate more rapidly. Shuttlecocks also have a high
        top speed compared to the balls in other racquet sports. The flight of
        the shuttlecock gives the sport its distinctive nature.</p>
      <p>The game developed in British India from the earlier game of battledore
        and shuttlecock. European play came to be dominated by Denmark but the
        game has become very popular in Asia, with recent competitions dominated
        by China. Since 1992, badminton has been a Summer Olympic sportwith four
        events: men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, and women's
        doubles, with mixed doubles added four years later. At high levels of
        play, the sport demands excellent fitness: players require aerobic
        stamina, agility, strength, speed, and precision. It is also a technical
        sport, requiring good motor coordination and the development of
        sophisticated racquet movement.</p>
